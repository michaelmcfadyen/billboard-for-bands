Framework Documentation
-----------------------
The framework is documented with Doxygen.  Doxygen is a document system which
uses inline comments to generate complete documentation.

To generate documentation, run 'doxygen' from the package root directory.

More information about Doxygen can be found here:

LEGO Mindstorms NXT Documentation
---------------------------------
LEGO provides documentation for the Bluetooth communication protocol, hardware
interfaces, and schematics.  This documentation is, however very large and
copywrited, so it is not checked in.

This documentation can be retrieved here:

    * Hardware Developer Kit (HDK)      - Hardware interfaces and schematics
